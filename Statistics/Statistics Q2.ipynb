    "Q-2. Consider a dataset containing the heights (in centimeters) of 1000 individuals. The mean height is 170 cm with a standard deviation of 10 cm. The dataset is approximately normally distributed, and its skewness is approximately zero. Based on this information, answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1 a. What percentage of individuals in the dataset have heights between 160 cm and 180 cm?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- To find the percentage of individuals with heights between 160 cm and 180 cm, we can use the z-score formula. The z-score represents the number of standard deviations an individual's height is from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The z-score formula is: z = (x - μ) / σ\n",
    "\n",
    "where: z = z-score ,x = individual's height ,μ = mean height ,σ = standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "For 160 cm: z1 = (160 - 170) / 10 = -1\n",
    "\n",
    "For 180 cm: z2 = (180 - 170) / 10 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "now use a standard normal distribution table or calculator to find the percentage of individuals between these z-scores Using the table the approximate percentage is 68%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2 b. If we randomly select 100 individuals from the dataset, what is the probability that their average height is greater than 175 cm?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- The mean of the sample means will still be 170 cm because the distribution of the sample means is centered around the population mean. However, the standard deviation of the sample means will be given by the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "σ(𝑥̅) = σ / √n\n",
    "\n",
    "where: σ(𝑥̅) = standard deviation of the sample means ,σ = standard deviation of the population ,n = sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, σ = 10 cm and n = 100. Therefore,\n",
    "\n",
    "σ(𝑥̅) = 10 / √100 = 10 / 10 = 1 cm\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the z-score formula to calculate the probability that the average height is greater than 175 cm:\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (x - μ) / σ(𝑥̅) = (175 - 170) / 1 = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find the probability of z > 5 to be very close to 0. Therefore, the probability that the average height of the randomly selected 100 individuals is greater than 175 cm is approximately 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. To find the z-score corresponding to a height of 185 cm, we can use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (x - μ) / σ\n",
    "\n",
    "where: z = z-score x = individual's height μ = mean height σ = standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (185 - 170) / 10 = 15 / 10 = 1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "The z-score corresponding to a height of 185 cm is 1.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. If 5% of the dataset has heights below a certain value, we can find the threshold height by using a standard normal distribution table or calculator to find the z-score that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the standard normal distribution table, the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.05 (5%) is approximately -1.645.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the z-score formula: -1.645 = (x - 170) / 10\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for x:\n",
    "\n",
    "-1.645 * 10 = x - 170\n",
    "\n",
    "-16.45 = x - 170\n",
    "\n",
    "x ≈ 170 - 16.45\n",
    "\n",
    "x ≈ 153.55\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the approximate height corresponding to the 5% threshold is 153.55 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "e. The coefficient of variation (CV) is a measure of relative variability and is calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. In this case, the CV can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "CV = (σ / μ) * 100\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "CV = coefficient of variation ,σ = standard deviation ,μ = mean\n",
    "\n",
    "CV = (10 / 170) * 100 ≈ 5.88\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the coefficient of variation (CV) for the dataset is approximately 5.88%.\n",
    "\n",
    "F. Since the dataset is approximately normally distributed and its skewness is approximately zero, we can conclude that the skewness of the dataset is indeed close to zero."
